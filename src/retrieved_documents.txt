IMPACT REPORT
Green Lead is a social enterprise based in Bangladesh. Traditional
leadership practiced worldwide has failed to deal with climate change.
We believe we need a different kind of leadership, i.e., green leadership,
to tackle the climate crisis. So, we are working to develop and promote
green leadership among people and organizations to enable climate
action at a scale, every day.
We are on a mission to educate, engage, and empower individuals and
organizations to enhance their capacity for addressing the impacts of
climate change.
We envision a green world where everyone equally cares about people
